Steps to run app locally:
    i. Open terminal.
    ii. Go to the project folder.
    iii.Run the commands in the following order:
        1.cd server/
        2.npm start
    iv. Open another terminal and run commands in the following order:
        1.cd client/
        2. npm start

    The project will now be running locally(most likely on localhost:3000)

Problems faced:
    1. I had worked with the StreamAPI very first time. So it was a bit challenging,but intresting.
    2. I wasn't able to host my backend online because I haven't done it previously and also time was a constraint. And since backend cannot be hosted, hosting the frontend only wouldn't have helped but still I did(though it wont be working).
